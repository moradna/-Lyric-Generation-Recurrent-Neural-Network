# Lyric-Generation-Recurrent-Neural-Network
In this assignment,I'm developing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can learn the lyrics and melodies of songs, and then predict the remaining lyrics given a melody and a few starting words.

## Data:
- `lyrics_train_set.csv`- contain 600 song lyrics for the training of popular artists.
- `lyrics_test_set.csv`- contain 5 songs for the test set of popular artists.
- `A.zip` - Midi files for each song containing just the song's melody without the lyrics.
